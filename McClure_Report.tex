\begin{abstract}
This paper will discuss the kinematic modeling of a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) robotic arm constructed using Dynamixel motors. A brief overview of other dynamixel based robots will be given, and used to showcase this arm's design. The arm will be modeled using Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. From there, the forward kinematic map will be established, and the analytical, spatial, and geometric jacobians will be derived. Finally, the inverse kinematics of the robot will be found geometrically.

\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} the recent past, the cost of components has limited widespread use of robotics in industry. However, in recent years, the cost of robotics production has dropped\cite{west2015happens}. An example of this price drop can be seen in types of actuators like the Dynamixel series of servos producted by Robotis\cite{dynamixel}. Dyamixel servos are discrete components that can be daisy chained together and controlled centrally using RS-485 or TTL communication protocols\cite{dynamixelChart}. These motors have allowed for fabrication of affordable custom systems, but are also lightweight and easily configurabled. These factors have led the Univeristy of Louisville Next Generation Systems (NGS) lab to use dynamixel based arms for research projects. This paper will seek to discuss the use of dynamixel servos in contemporary robot research, and will expound upon the design of an NGS dynamixel arm.
\par A recent project by NGS member, and PH.D. candidate, Sumit Das focused on using neural networks to map force feedback along a 6-joint arm comprised entirely of MX-106 dynamixel servos and Robotis produced servo brackets. This paper will seek to discuss the justification for using dynamixel motors improve the lab's modeling of that 6-joint arm. The de by developing a forward kinematic map, computing the system's jacobians, and geometrically deriving the inverse kinematic equations.

\section{Discussion}The initial step in describing a robot is to create an equation to describe the robot's end effector position(s) based on joint variable settings.

		\hline
		Link   & $\alpha$ & a     & d     & $\theta$   \\

\subsection{Homogenous Transformation Matrices}
Using the above table, the change in position and orientation
associated with moving from a joint to the end of the link
attached to it can be described accoring to equation \ref{A_Matrix}. In this
equation, A is a homogenous transformation matrix that is
the product of rotations around and translation along specified
axes using the DH-Table parameters for a given joint i.

\begin{equation}\label{A_Matrix}
	A_i^i-1=Rot_z(\theta_i)Tran_z(d_i)Tran_x(a_i)Rot_z(\alpha_i)
\end{equation}

The homogenous transformation matrix for the entire robot,
which will map the end effector position to the base frame,
can be calculated as the multiplicative product of all joint
transformation matrices. Equation 2 shows this mapping for
a n-joint system\ref{T_Matrix}.

\begin{equation}\label{T_Matrix}
	H=T_0^n = A_1^0*A_2^1 \dots*A_n^{n-1}
\end{equation}

\section{Jacobians}
Along with knowing the instantaenous position and orientation
values for the arm, modeling the robot requires a way
to calculate the arm\'s velocity given a change in any joint
values ($\theta$s). Three different forms are used for this process,
all being different types of Jacobians. These three forms are:
the analytical Jacobian, the spatial Jacobian, and the geometric
Jacobian.

\subsection{Analytical Jacobian}
The analytical Jacobian (5) is comprised of a linear velocity
sub-Jacobian (3) vertically concatinated with a angular velocity
sub-Jacobian (4). The calculated value for the resulting
analytical Jacobian can be found in Appendix B. The equations
for calculating each column can be expressed differently based
on whether the column represents a prismatic or a revolute
joint Since the dynamixel arm only has revolute joints, only
the that expression is shown.
